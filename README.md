### Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Brandon.

I am an experienced *Enterprise Solutions Architect* and *Full Stack Developer* who is currently diving down the rabbit hole of *Web3 Programming*. I recently left my day job to free up time for my relentless pursuit of next generation technologies. I have a broad range of software development skills augmented by in-depth knowledge of cloud infrastructure architecture and server configuration patterns. I have a proven background in project leadership and communication, allowing me to confidently achieve any business goal. I am actively seeking business partnerships and new venture opportunities of all kinds.
